# Django CORS Handling Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides instructions on how to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in a Django application. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. Managing CORS settings is crucial for enabling your Django application to accept requests from different origins while maintaining security.

## Key Features

- **Installation of `django-cors-headers`:** Instructions for installing the package that helps manage CORS headers in Django.
- **Configuration:** Steps to configure CORS settings, including allowing all origins or specifying allowed origins, methods, and headers.
- **Example Configuration:** A sample configuration for `settings.py` to demonstrate how to set up CORS handling in your Django project.

## Purpose

This documentation is designed to guide you through setting up and configuring CORS handling in your Django project, ensuring that your application can interact with external domains as required while adhering to security best practices.

For detailed instructions on installation and configuration, refer to the sections in this documentation.
